# day 1 notes

- watch the video again & take notes
- so the idea was to makemore of pan tadeusz, i can see that we start with only words (names); so it might be kinda harder to follow with that dataset
- but i think, later on we switch to a poem so thats fine? i can follow with names for starters, maybe find a dataset of polish names so its more in the tone of what im tryng to achive
