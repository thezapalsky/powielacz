# day 1 notes

- watch the video again & take notes
- so the idea was to makemore of pan tadeusz, i can see that we start with only words (names); so it might be kinda harder to follow with that dataset
- but i think, later on we switch to a poem so thats fine? i can follow with names for starters, maybe find a dataset of polish names so its more in the tone of what im tryng to achive

- mkay, all setup i think; repo is in place with correct config and other stuff, lets follow the bigram now

- continuing with the bigram notebook, got some samples that look name-like
